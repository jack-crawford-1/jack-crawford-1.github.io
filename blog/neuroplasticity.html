        <h3>How does understanding of neuroplasticity benefit people?</h3>
        <p>
          Neuroplasticity is a relatively new idea that our brains are
          malleable and we can rewire and strengthen connections of our
          neurons. This is against the old way of thinking that we are born
          with a certain level of intelligence and this remains unchanged over
          our life time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Simply understating that basic idea that we can get smarter through
          repetition and ideation allows us to remove the biggest barrier to
          learning, our own preconceptions and beliefs in ourselves.
        </p>

          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X0mgOOSpLU" target="_blank">Carol Dweck</a>
          , a respected psychologist who specialises in motivation
          and mindset, discussed some powerful concepts in her 2014 TED talk,
          where she compares the "power of yet" to the "tyranny of now". This
          is a great way to simplify the complex thought process of people,
          highlighting that a growth mindset ("yet"), can allow you to
          persistently confront a problem with the goal of improving, whereas
          the fixed mindset ("now"), increases the likelihood the person will
          feel "dumb" and can't get past that barrier.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are studies that show that by imagining an activity and
          "mentally practicing", this can have similar effects compared with
          if that person had physically engaged in that activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the Brain Injury Alliance article written by Ed Roth,
          "Olympic star swimmer Michael Phelps, for example, was trained to
          visualise a mental image of a race when he wakes up, then again when
          he goes to sleep. This includes every detail from lining up at the
          starting block all the way through to his victory celebration."
        </p>

        <p>
          For those who do not know Michael Phelps, he has won 23 gold medals
          for at the Olympics and is considered to be one of the GOAT of the
          sport.

          How would you engage in principles for your benefit and ways to
          increase neuroplasticity
        </h3>
        <p>To increase my neuroplasticity, I plan to:</p>
        <ul class="article-ul">
          <li>
            Regularly engage in activities that push my cognitive boundaries
            (hard challenges)
          </li>
          <li>
            Cultivate diverse experiences that expose me to new ideas and
            perspectives.
          </li>
          <li>Maintain a balanced diet</li>
          <li>
            Ensure ample sleep for optimal brain processing and memory
            consolidation.
          </li>
          <li>Practice mindfulness and meditation to support brain health</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What is the Growth Mindset and why is it relearnt:</h3>
        <p>
          The growth mindset is the belief that intelligence and talents can
          be developed through dedication, hard work, and input from others.
          It is a powerful concept that pushes us towards embracing
          challenges, persisting in the face of setbacks, and seeing effort as
          a path to success.
        </p>

        <h3>Surprises</h3>
        <p>
          It was a surprise on just how much information there is on these
          topics online and how little it was taught when I was growing up.
          The only exposure I've had to this is in previous jobs but I was
          surprised to see that little was being done to teach the younger
          generation, who would no doubt benefit the most.
        </p>

        <h3>To weave a growth mindset into my learning journey, I will:</h3>
        <ul class="article-ul">
          <li>
            Approach challenges with curiosity and see them as opportunities
            to grow.
          </li>
          <li>Value the process of learning as much as the results</li>
          <li>Embrace mistakes as a natural part of the learning process.</li>
          <li>
            Seek out feedback and constructive criticism for self-improvement.
          </li>
        </ul>
