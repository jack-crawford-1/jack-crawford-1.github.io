        <h2 class="lp-header">Bootcamp</h2>
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>
          During this course, I hope to gain a solid base in technical skills that give me the option to pursue various
          paths later in life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similar with the start of Foundations, I'm still very open to what the future holds. I hope to use some of the
          skills to work on projects that enhance digital security and privacy, or develop applications that utilise
          machine learning to improve daily life. Ultimately, the goal is to be part of something that address those
          things we want to live with or without, through technology.
        </p>


        <h3>Learning Strengths and Limitations</h3>
        <p>
          Throughout Foundations, I've become more aware of my strengths and limitations. My analytical skills and
          technical understanding have deepened, but I've also recognised the need for better stress management and
          prioritisation.
        </p>

        <h3>Non-technical Skills Development</h3>
        <p>
          Staying focused and managing workload effectively will likely be my biggest non-technical challenge. The
          Bootcamp's fast pace and the necessity of working closely with others on complex projects will test my
          organisational skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          I aim to develop my communication skills further, especially in articulating technical concepts to
          non-technical people.I believe improving these human skills will be instrumental in my success during and
          after the Bootcamp.
        </p>


        <h3>Managing Workload</h3>
        <p>
          I commit to managing my workload by following the Dev Academy schedule, incorporating breaks to prevent
          burnout, and regularly reassessing my priorities to stay on track. I will work productively by maintaining
          open communication with my cohort and facilitators, ensuring a collaborative and supportive learning
          environment.
        </p>


        <h3>Expectation</h3>
        <p>
          Probably similar to foundations in that I hope the Bootcamp team to provide constructive feedback and their
          experiences. Support, to me, looks like being available for questions, offering resources for extra learning,
          and fostering a collaborative learning environment.
        </p>

        <h3>Scheduling Commitments</h3>
        <p>
          I expect myself to stay committed, manage my time effectively, and be proactive in seeking help. I plan to
          first utilise available resources, such as course materials and online forums, and then turn to peers and
          instructors when I'm stuck.
        </p>
        <div class="page-spacer"></div>
        <h2 class="lp-header">Foundations</h2>

        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>
          At the moment I'm very open to different career paths, I just know a
          computer will likely be at the heart of it. I'm interested in cyber
          security, web design, machine learning, API's, and systems to name a
          few. Ideally I will love my job and be in a role that adds something
          good to peoples lives.
        </p>
        <!-- <img src="/images/learning.png" alt="person learning" class="blog-img" /> -->
        <h3>Learning Strengths and Limitations</h3>
        <p>
          Strengths: I have a strong analytical mindset and a quick grasp of
          technical concepts along with a curious mindset and openness to
          learn new information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Limitations: I could improve my time management, especially when
          balancing multiple projects. With such a high-intensity course, I
          will need to be careful not to go over time box suggestions and keep
          momentum up.
        </p>

        <h3>Non-technical Skills Development</h3>
        <p>
          I aim to enhance my communication skills to articulate technical
          information clearly to non-technical stakeholders. I also want to
          foster stronger teamwork, being able to work in diverse groups.
          Lastly, developing resilience and stress management strategies would
          be crucial for maintaining a healthy work-life balance.
        </p>
        <h3>Managing Workload</h3>
        <p>
          To manage my workload productively, I will try work to a structured
          schedule that includes dedicated study blocks and breaks to prevent
          burnout.
        </p>
        <p>
          In moments of high stress or when feeling overwhelmed, I will step
          back to assess my priorities, take a second to breath, or ask my
          classmates for support to regain focus
        </p>
        <h3>Seeking Help: I will seek help by</h3>
        <p>
          If there is concern I wont meet the deadlines, or don't understand
          the concepts, I will first seek self-help by reviewing the course
          material, looking online and seeking out others who may have more
          insights.
        </p>
        <!-- <img src="/images/ teamwork.png" alt="teamwork" class="blog-img" /> -->
        <h3>Expectation</h3>
        <p>
          There are so many unknown unknown's when learning something new, so
          the biggest hope I have is for guidance on areas that would help me
          upskill quickly. Constructive feedback and sharing their experiences
          would be extremely helpful.
        </p>
        <h3>Scheduling Commitments</h3>
        <p>
          I've been looking forward to this course for a while, so have done
          my best to remove any conflicts with my time for the next few months
          but life inevitably has it's own plans. I will try to communicate
          any conflicts with as much notice as possible. I am lucky to have a
          strong support network and will leverage this as much as possible.
