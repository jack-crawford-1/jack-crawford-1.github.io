        <h1>Learning Plan</h1>

        <h3>20 January 2024</h3>
      </header>
      <div class="article-content">
        <p>
          The aim of this blog is to reflect on my learning plan to help guide
          me through this course.
        </p>
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>
          At the moment I'm very open to different career paths, I just know a
          computer will likely be at the heart of it. I'm interested in cyber
          security, web design, machine learning, API's, and systems to name a
          few. Ideally I will love my job and be in a role that adds something
          good to peoples lives.
        </p>

        <h3>Learning Strengths and Limitations</h3>
        <p>
          Strengths: I have a strong analytical mindset and a quick grasp of
          technical concepts along with a curious mindset and openness to
          learn new information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Limitations: I could improve my time management, especially when
          balancing multiple projects. With such a high-intensity course, I
          will need to be careful not to go over time box suggestions and keep
          momentum up.
        </p>

        <h3>Non-technical Skills Development</h3>
        <p>
          I aim to enhance my communication skills to articulate technical
          information clearly to non-technical stakeholders. I also want to
          foster stronger teamwork, being able to work in diverse groups.
          Lastly, developing resilience and stress management strategies would
          be crucial for maintaining a healthy work-life balance.
        </p>
        <h3>Managing Workload</h3>
        <p>
          To manage my workload productively, I will try work to a structured
          schedule that includes dedicated study blocks and breaks to prevent
          burnout.
        </p>
        <p>
          In moments of high stress or when feeling overwhelmed, I will step
          back to assess my priorities, take a second to breath, or ask my
          classmates for support to regain focus
        </p>
        <h3>Seeking Help: I will seek help by</h3>
        <p>
          If there is concern I wont meet the deadlines, or don't understand
          the concepts, I will first seek self-help by reviewing the course
          material, looking online and seeking out others who may have more
          insights.
        </p>

        <h3>Expectation</h3>
        <p>
          There are so many unknown unknown's when learning something new, so
          the biggest hope I have is for guidance on areas that would help me
          upskill quickly. Constructive feedback and sharing their experiences
          would be extremely helpful.
        </p>
        <h3>Scheduling Commitments</h3>
        <p>
          I've been looking forward to this course for a while, so have done
          my best to remove any conflicts with my time for the next few months
          but life inevitably has it's own plans. I will try to communicate
          any conflicts with as much notice as possible. I am lucky to have a
          strong support network and will leverage this as much as possible.
