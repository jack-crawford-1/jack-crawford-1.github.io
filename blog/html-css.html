      <h2>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h2>
      <p>
        Borders, margins and padding are, put simply, CSS styling that allows
        developers to move and position different parts (or elements) of a web
        page. Borders define the edges, margins create space between elements,
        and padding ensures content within elements is neatly framed and not too
        close or far from the border.
      </p>
      <h3>Borders</h3>
      <p>
        The border is the line that wraps around an element. It can be styled in
        terms of width, colour and style. Below is an example of an element with
        a border that is 3 pixels wide, coloured green with dashed lines as the
        style of border.
      </p>

      <h3>Padding</h3>
      <p>
        Padding is the space between the border and the content of the element.
        It increases the inner space of the element. The first image has padding
        of 5px and the second image has padding of 15 pixels, moving the border
        further away from the element.
      </p>
      <!--<screenshot goes here> or actual box example using the above specs-->

      <h3>Margin</h3>
      <p>
        Margin is the space outside the border. It creates distance between
        different elements. This is helpful to set space between two elements on
        a page, for example you might want some space between two images.
      </p>

      <h3>In real terms</h3>
      <p>
        A helpful analogy I came across was thinking of a picture in a frame
        hung on the wall. The photo itself is the element. The space between the
        photo and the frame is the padding. The frame is the border and the
        space between the edge of the frame and the next photo hanging on the
        wall is margin.
      </p>
      <!--Image of picture frame goes here>-->
      <h3>How to</h3>
      <p>
        To set the border, margin or padding of an element, we need to reference
        the html element in the CSS. Going back to our analogy, we need to tell
        the decorators which picture frame needs to be changed (linking the css
        to html) and then how thick and what style the frame should be (border),
        how far the photo should sit away from the inner frame (padding) and how
        far the frame the next frame on the wall should be (margin). The CSS
        code needed to change the border, margin and padding of an element can
        be simplified to the lines below:
      </p>
      <!--Code snippet goes here-->
      <p>
        In this example, we have a div element with a light blue background.
        We've added a green border of 2px, padding of 20px, and a margin of
        15px. The result looks like this:
