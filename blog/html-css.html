      <h2>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h2>
      <p>
        Borders, margins and padding are, put simply, CSS styling that allows
        developers to move and position different parts (or elements) of a web
        page. Borders define the edges, margins create space between elements,
        and padding ensures content within elements is neatly framed and not too
        close or far from the border.
      </p>
      <h3>Borders</h3>
      <p>
        The border is the line that wraps around an element. It can be styled in
        terms of width, colour and style. Below is an example of an element with
        a border that is 10 pixels wide, coloured black with a solid line as the
        style of border.
      </p>
      <code>
        <span class="class-code">.box</span> { <br />
        <span class="class-selector">background-color</span>: light-blue;<br />
        <span class="class-selector">border:</span>
        <span class="selected">10px</span> solid black;<br />
        }
      </code>

      <div class="example-container">
        <div class="example-box-padding" id="fill-colour"></div>
      </div>

      <h3>Padding</h3>
      <p>
        Padding is the space between the border and the content of the element.
        It increases the inner space of the element. In the example below, the
        white space between the blue element and the black border is the padding
        and keeps the element 15 pixels away from the border.
      </p>

      <code>
        <span class="class-code">.box</span> { <br />
        <span class="class-selector">background-color</span>: light-blue;<br />
        <span class="class-selector">border:</span
        ><span class="selected"> 10px</span> solid black;<br />
        <span class="class-selector">padding:</span
        ><span class="selected"> 15px</span>;<br />
        }
      </code>

      <div class="example-container">
        <div class="example-box-padding">
          <div class="example-box"></div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <!--<screenshot goes here> or actual box example using the above specs-->

      <h3>Margin</h3>
      <p>
        Margin is the space outside the border. It creates distance between
        different elements. This is helpful to set space between two elements on
        a page. The dashed lines in the example below represent the edge of the
        webpage but could also be another element on the page.
      </p>

      <code>
        <span class="class-code">.box</span> { <br />
        <span class="class-selector">background-color</span>: light-blue;<br />
        <span class="class-selector">border:</span>
        <span class="selected">10px</span> solid black;<br />
        <span class="class-selector">padding:</span
        ><span class="selected">15px</span>;<br />
        <span class="class-selector">margin:</span
        ><span class="selected"> 15px 45px 30px 45px</span>;<br />
        }
      </code>

      <div class="example-container">
        <div class="example-box-margin">
          <div class="example-box-padding">
            <div class="example-box"></div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Too Much Jargon</h3>
      <p>
        A helpful analogy I came across was thinking of a picture in a frame
        hung on the wall. The photo itself is the element. The space between the
        photo and the frame is the padding. The frame is the border and the
        space between the edge of the frame and the next photo hanging on the
        wall is margin.
      </p>

      <img
        src="https://www.framebridge.com/cdn/shop/files/FlorenceLifestyle.jpg?v=1704760944"
        alt="picture in frame"
        width="auto"
        height="300px"
      />
      <!--Image of picture frame goes here>-->
      <p>
        To set the border, margin or padding of an element, we need to reference
        the html element in the CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using our analogy, we need to tell the decorators which picture frame
        needs to be changed (linking the css to html) and then how thick and
        what style the frame should be (border), how far the photo should sit
        away from the inner frame (padding) and how far the frame the next frame
        on the wall should be (margin).
      </p>

      <h3>News To Me</h3>

      <p>
        One of the concepts I came across that wasn't intuitive was the idea of
        collapsing margins. This is where the total margin of two elements might
        be less than the margin of the individual elements added together.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another was the value is setting the box sizing. By default, padding and
        border increase the size of an element. However, using the box-sizing
        property, you can include them in the element's total width and height.
        This can help avoid running into sizing problems down the line.
      </p>

      <p>
        As you can now see, CSS borders, margins, and padding are more than just
        spacing and stylistic details. They are essential tools for creating
        responsive and well-structured web pages.
