					<h3>What is Te whare tapa whā?</h3>
					<p>
						Introduced by Sir Mason Durie in 1984, Te whare tapa whā offers a
						holistic view on health from a Māori standpoint, looking at four
						pillars of wellbeing:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Physical wellbeing (taha tinana)</li>
						<li>Mental wellbeing (taha hinengaro)</li>
						<li>Spiritual wellbeing (taha wairua)</li>
						<li>Family wellbeing (taha whānau)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The model is likened to a wharenui (meeting house) with four walls,
						each representing one of these wellbeing dimensions. The bond of the
						wharenui with the whenua (land) lays the groundwork for these four
						aspects of health.

					<h3>Taha Tinana (physical wellbeing)</h3>
					<p>
						Taha tinana is your physical wellbeing. It is about how your body
						grows, feels and moves, and how you care for it. For me, this is
						getting a good nights sleep, regular exercise and healthy food. I'll
						often, as I'm sure most of us do, slip from good habbits from time
						to time. To get back to a good Taha Tinana, it's important to
						refocus after setbacks
					</p>
					<h3>Taha Hinengaro (emotional and mental wellbeing)</h3>
					<p>
						Taha hinengaro is your mind, heart, conscience, thoughts and
						feelings. For me, this is about taking active steps to look after my
						mental health, by talking with friends and family about what I'm
						finding tough. It's also about taking time away for myself to focus
						and reflect to help get perspective. Being open to new ways of
						managing stress or engaging with people has been a big asset in for
						me in helping achieve Taha Hinengaro.
					</p>
					<h3>Taha Wairua (spiritual wellbeing)</h3>
					<p>
						Your spiritual essence is your life force. This is who and what you
						are, where you have come from and where you are going. I have always
						had a strong connection with nature and find I am most calm when
						spending time in remote and beautiful sceneries while hiking. I
						appreciate the fact that at all turns, the odds have been stacked
						against people to even exist, so to be here is pretty epic.
					</p>
					<h3>Taha Whānau (family wellbeing)</h3>
					<p>
						Taha whānau is about who makes you feel like you belong, who you
						care about and who you share your life with. I am very lucky to have
						a supportive partner, great friends and a close family. These
						relationships have allowed me to try and fail, knowing I'll have
						support should I need it. Case and point is my enrty into the Dev
						Academy programme. I have been able to quit my job and spend 4
						months studying something I am passionate about as my partner is
						amazing with her support.
