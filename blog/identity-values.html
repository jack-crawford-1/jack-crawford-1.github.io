          <p>
            The aim of this blog is to reflect on my core personal values, and
            my strengths and limitations.
          </p>
          <h3>Ethical Decisions: Standing by Integrity</h3>
          <p>
            A recent ethical decision I made was whether to report a mistake at
            work. We we're set to roll out new marketing that had gone through a
            review process and been signed off, however right before we sent I
            noticed some of the data was incorrect.
          </p>

          <p>
            The data on the new marketing material would have shown the value of
            some of our services to be more impressive than it actually was,
            which as a sales person, would have made my job considerably easier
            but I knew I couldnâ€™t conscionably mislead my clients.
          </p>

          <p>
            There was also some pushback from management who felt the messaging
            was "close enough" to accurate so by me publicly highlighting the
            issue, there was pressure to fix but also potential resentment from
            those above.
          </p>

          <p>
            There was a need to weigh up my own personal conscience and the
            drive to succeed in my role as an Account Manager. Ultimately, I am
            happy to build stronger, more trust based relationships over short
            term gain to in hindsight I feel I made the right call.
          </p>

          <h3>The Role of Culture and Community</h3>
          <p>
            I've been lucky to have a supportive family and close friends who
            push me to succeed. There's a sense of not wanting to let down the
            people around me which helps motivate when at times self motivation
            is tough.
          </p>

          <h3>Strengths and Limitations: The Balancing Act</h3>
          <p>
            My curiosity and willingness to try new things will be a big help
            throughout this course. Knowing that I will not understand
            everything but having that internal monologue of "wow, that's cool"
            or " how the heck did that do that" pushing me to dig in and learn.
          </p>

          <p>
            In terms of limitations, often I feel the curiosity, which I know I
            have just said is my biggest strength, can also derail me from
            sticking with things for the long run. With learning being a
            constant thing, and there being such a big need to reinforce
            learning through practice, I'll need to focus on not getting drawn
            down the proverbial rabbit hole.
          </p>

          <h3>Navigating Tension and Collaborative Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            A project I was working on recently had stakeholders from multiple
            departments, some of whom volunteered and were excited to
            contribute, and others who had the required knowledge but did not
            want to be a part of the project, and as a result, were hard to
            engage with.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was a lot of tension with ideas being shot down and limited
            progress. The strategy used by some was to push the company
            messaging about the value of the work to try and align the two
            sides. In hindsight, it would have been more effective to understand
            the reluctance of some of the team and try to find common ground
            with areas of work that could still add value.
          </p>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>

          <p>
            Through the lens of these experiences, I am learning that the
            journey of personal and professional growth is as much about
            confronting our limitations as it is about leveraging our strengths.
