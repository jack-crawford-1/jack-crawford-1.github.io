        <h3>Blocked on a simple problem</h3>
        <p>
          One where I found myself scratching my head was the Gradebook exercise. For context, the goal was to create an
          object (the gradebook) which held an array of test results for a group of students.
        </p>
        <p>Giving the gradebook a new empty object was straightforward:</p>
        <code>
          gradebook {}
          </code>
        <p>So was (with a bit of looking back) adding each student to the gradebook object.
          This loops through the students array and adds it to the gradebook object:
        </p>
        <code>
          students<span class="class-code ">.forEach</span>((student) => {
          gradebook[student] = {};
          })
          </code>
        <p>But I got stuck here. The task now was to add scores to each student in the gradebook.</p>
        <code>
          scores<span class="class-code ">.forEach</span>((testScore) => {
          gradebook[students[testScore]] = {scores};
          });
          </code>
        <p>The `testScore` isn't a single score; it's actually an array of scores for one student since `scores` is an
          array of arrays.
          Also, the way I had assigned to {scores} wasn't right. This ended up creating an object with a property
          `scores`
          that contained the entire `scores` array, instead of just the individual student's scores.
          I had assumed testScore could directly index students, and misunderstood how to correctly assign scores to
          each
          student.
        </p>
        <p>What I needed to do was match each student with their corresponding array of scores.</p>
        <code>
          students<span class="class-code ">.forEach</span>((student, index) => {
          gradebook[student].testScores = scores[index];
          })
          </code>
        <p>I had gone to Google, which would have likely given me the answers I needed, but I wan't exactlty sure the
          solution I was looking for. I then went back and skimmed the previous videos hoping to come across something
          that would give me that lightbulb moment.
        </p>
        <p>I could have spent hours going in circles without spotting the glaring fundemental issue with my code, but
          instead I reached out to the Dev Academy Discord server to get a sense-check if I was heading in the right
          direction. Gerard pointed out the points above, and that a slightly different approach should get a better
          result.
        </p>

        <p>In hindsight, sharing roadblocks earlier with others in my course would have been a great way to get
          perspective
          on a problem, allowing me to refocus. Concerns around appearing "dumb" (conscious and unconscious), are one of
          the bigger barriers and one that I'll need to keep reminding myself to be mindful of. Even though it's easy to
          forget, it's nice to know that others in the cohort are having similar challenges and have been able to
          overcome
          them, showing it can be done.

        <h3> Elegantly Solving a Problem</h3>
        <p>
          The task was to create a digital representation of a family tree starting with an individual named Terah. We
          began with:
        </p>
        <code>
          <span class="class-code-red">let</span> terah = {
          name: 'Terah',
          age: 32,
          height: 172,
          hairColor: 'brown'
          }
          </code>
        <p>
          From here, we needed to expand Terah's world to include relationships and life changes. Enter Adam. He starts
          as a blank slate (empty object)
        </p>
        <code>
          <span class="class-code-red">let</span> adam = {}
          </code>
        <p>
          We then define Adam by giving him a name and connecting him to Terah:
        </p>
        <code>
          adam.name = "Adam";
          adam.spouse = terah;
          </code>
        <p>
          It makes sense that if Adam is connected to Terah, then Terah is also linked to Adam
        </p>
        <code>
          terah.spouse = adam;
          terah.age = 33;
          </code>
        <p>
          Through these steps, we've not only captured data but also told a demonstrated a real-world story of
          relationships. We've shown that objects in JavaScript are more than just containers for values but instead,
          are the building blocks for narratives.
