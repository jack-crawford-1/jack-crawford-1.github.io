          <h3>JavaScript: Bringing Your Website to Life</h3>
          <p>
            Imagine you've just decorated a room (that's your HTML) and picked
            the perfect lighting and paint colours (that's your CSS). Now, how
            do you make it more than just a pretty space? That's where
            JavaScript comes in. It's like adding smart devices to your room
            that react to your actions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Below are some important concepts that allow for that room reaction
          </p>
          <img

          <h2>Everyday Life and Programming Concepts</h2>
          <p>
            Think about your morning routine. You wake up, check the weather,
            and decide what to wear. This decision making process is like
            control flow in programming.
          </p>
          <p>
            For something you do repeatedly, like checking the lights are off in
            each room before leaving the house. This repetition is similar to
            loops in JavaScript, where you perform an action until a certain
            condition is met.
          </p>
          <p>
            The below example shows a simple countdown loop where we are telling
            the computer to start a loop at number 4 (let countdown = 4). Each
            time the loop runs it will reduce the number by one (countdown--).
            And then finally stop the loop when it reaches zero (countdown >= 0)
          </p>

          <!--  LOOP EXAMPLE  -->
          <code>
            <span class="class-code-leader">for</span> (<span class="class-code"
              >let</span
            >
            countdown = <span class="selected">4</span>; countdown >=
            <span class="selected">0</span>; countdown--) {<br />
            <span class="code-commnents line-start"
              >// Runs 5 times, with values of countdown 4 through 0.</span
            >
            <br />
            <span class="line-start">console.</span
            ><span class="class-selector-js">log</span>(<span class="selected"
              >`Countdown:${countdown}`</span
            >);<br />}
          </code>

          <h2>The DOM: Your Page's Personal Helper</h2>
          <p>
            Ever wondered how clicking a button on a webpage can magically
            change what you see? That's the DOM (Document Object Model) in
            action! It's like having a personal assistant who rearranges your
            room when you ask. JavaScript talks to this assistant to update your
            webpage without needing a full makeover.
          </p>
          <p>
            The below example shows how we can select all the paragraphs in a
            HTML document and assign it to a variable, "paragraphs" in the
            Javascript file. This allows us to change, add or remove all the
            paragraphs without editing the HTML file
          </p>
          <!--  ACCESSING THE DOM EXAMPLE  -->
          <code
            ><span class="class-code">const</span
            ><span class="js-text">paragraphs</span> =
            <span class="class-selector-js">document</span>.<span
              class="class-code-red"
              >querySelectorAll</span
            >("p");
          </code>
          <h2>Arrays vs. Objects: Organising Your Data</h2>
          <p>
            Arrays and objects in JavaScript are like different storage
            solutions. Arrays are like an ordered bookshelf, where you find
            books (elements) based on their position.
          </p>
          <p>
            This bookshelf is special because every slot for a book is numbered,
            starting from 0 and going up. If you want to find the third book,
            you don't need to know the title; you just go directly to slot 2
            (since we started counting from 0) and grab it
          </p>
          <!--  ARRAYS EXAMPLE  -->
          <code>
            <span class="class-code">let</span> favoriteBooks = ["Harry Potter",
            "The Hobbit", "1984"]; <br /><span class="code-commnents"
              >// Here, "Harry Potter" is in position 0, "The Hobbit" in
              position 1, and "1984" in position 2.</span
            >
            <br />console.<span class="class-selector-js">log</span
            >(favoriteBooks[1]); <br /><span class="code-commnents"
              >// This will log "The Hobbit" because it's in the second
              slot.</span
            >
          </code>
          <p>
            Now, consider you have a drawer where you keep all your
            knick-knacks, but instead of remembering which item is in which
            slot, you label each slot with the name of the item it contains.
            When you need your phone, you don't look for it in the third slot;
            you look for the slot labeled "phone."
          </p>
          <p>
            This is what objects are like in JavaScript. They store data in
            key-value pairs, where each key is like a label you can use to find
            the corresponding value
          </p>

          <!--  OBJECTS EXAMPLE  -->
          <code>
            <span class="class-code">let</span> itemDrawer = { phone: "iPhone",
            tablet: "iPad", watch: "Apple Watch" }; <br /><span
              class="code-commnents"
              >// Here, each item is identified by a label (key), such as
              "phone", "tablet", or "watch".</span
            >
            <br />console.<span class="class-selector-js">log</span
            >(itemDrawer.phone); <br />

            <span class="code-commnents"
              >// This will log "iPhone" because that's the value associated
              with the key "phone".</span
            >
          </code>
          <h2>Functions: Your Go-To Recipes</h2>
          <p>
            Functions in JavaScript are like your favourite recipes. They're a
            set of instructions you keep handy and reuse whenever you need to
            whip up that dish again. Similarly, functions in coding are reusable
            blocks that perform specific tasks, saving you from having to write
            more code.
          </p>

          <code>
            <span class="code-commnents"
              >// A function to mix ingredients and return a cake</span
            >
            <br />bakeCake(flavour, icing) { <br /><span class="code-commnents"
              >// mix the flavor and icing</span
            ><br /><span class="class-code">let</span> cake = `A delicious
            ${flavour} cake with ${icing} icing.`; <br />return cake;
            <span class="code-commnents">// Return the final cake </span><br />}
            <br /><span class="code-commnents">// following a recipe</span>
            <br /><span class="class-code">let</span> myCake =
            bakeCake("chocolate", "vanilla"); > <br />console.<span
              class="class-selector-js"
              >log</span
            >(myCake);
            <span class="code-commnents"
              >// Logs: A delicious chocolate cake with vanilla icing.</span
            >
          </code>
          <p>
            Just as you might have recipes for everything from breakfast to
            dinner, you can have functions for all sorts of tasks in
            programming. Functions make your code more efficient, organised, and
            reusable, just like how recipes make cooking more straightforward
            and predictable.
