        <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
        <p>At times it's hard to see how a problem is going to be able to be overcome so it was nice to read on the idea
          that the brain is malleable, and I'm capable of picking up new concepts. The "can't teach an old dog new
          tricks" saying needs to go</p>
        <p>Throughout the course, I found myself with an urge to take the easy approach and realised that some of the
          mindfulness exercises can really help refocus and allow me to tackle the harder challenges rather than feeling
          defeated and reverting to the easier task.
          Talking through or listening to someone describe their approach turned out to be an effective way to better
          understand.
        </p>
        <h3>The role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
        <p>These are hugely important! Being able to work well with other developers would require you to be able to
          clearly communicate complex ideas, work in close, multi-channelled teams, and leverage the skills and
          knowledge of those around them. Without these value, collaboration would be limited, innovation stifled, and
          productivity slowed. Being aware of your own strengths and limitations allows you to focus your efforts and
          not waste time.</p>
        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
        <p>The most surprising part has been the depth of introspection required. I've discovered that understanding
          coding isn't just about learning code, it's also about understanding how I think and learn. It's been great to
          see how self-awareness and reflection are integrated into learning and applying technical skills.</p>
        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
        <p>The most challenging aspect was definitely the shift from a fixed to a growth mindset. Overcoming the
          internal resistance to change and the self-imposed limits on my learning capacity was tough. It required
          constantly challenging my preconceptions about my abilities, taking a step back, and trying again.
        </p>
        <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web
          development Bootcamp course?</h3>
        <p>I think the emphasis on core learning comes from the understanding that technical skills alone don't make a
          great developer. The industry needs people who can adapt, learn continuously, and work well with others. By
          focusing on core learning, Dev Academy is preparing us not just for that job, but for a sustainable and
          adaptable career in tech. </p>
        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used
          that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
        <p>Not at all. While practicing the tech side is essential, the core learning has provided a strong foundation
          for how to approach problems, and continue learning in an ever-evolving field. It's an investment in the
          'soft' skills that complement the 'hard' skills of programming.
        </p>
        <p>This dual focus ensures that when I write code, I'm considering the broader context, which includes the
          impact of my work, and the ability to adapt and grow with the industry. Without this core learning, I would be
          less prepared for the real-world scenarios that require much more than just technical ability.</p>
